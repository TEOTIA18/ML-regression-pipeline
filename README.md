# ML-regression-pipeline
This machine learning model is designed for a regression task, where the goal is to predict a numerical target variable 'y' based on a set of input features labeled 'x1' to 'x8'. The model follows a supervised learning approach, meaning it is trained on labeled data to learn the relationship between the input features and the target variable.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is loaded from a CSV file. It consists of 150 samples, each containing the target variable 'y' and eight numerical features 'x1' to 'x8'. The initial data exploration includes checking the shape and data types of the dataset, as well as identifying if there are any missing values.

The model pipeline involves multiple steps:

Data Preprocessing: The features are standardized to ensure that all the features have a similar scale, which can improve the model's performance.
Polynomial Feature Generation: The pipeline includes the creation of polynomial features up to degree 2. This helps to capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable, providing the model with more flexibility.
Random Forest Regression: The pipeline utilizes a Random Forest regression model with 100 estimators. Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is a powerful algorithm that can handle non-linear relationships and reduce overfitting.
The model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation techniques to assess its generalization ability on unseen data. The mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) are used as evaluation metrics. R^2 measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable explained by the model, and MSE quantifies the prediction accuracy.

The pipeline is fine-tuned using GridSearchCV, which performs an exhaustive search over specified hyperparameter values to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the model. The hyperparameters being tuned include the degree of polynomial features, the number of trees in the Random Forest, and the maximum depth of each tree.

Once the pipeline is tuned, it is validated on the test set to ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data. The model's interpretation may be limited due to the complexity introduced by polynomial features and Random Forest. However, feature importances from the Random Forest can provide insights into the importance of each feature in making predictions.

Overall, the pipeline appears to perform well and produces interpretable results. The pipeline's strengths lie in its ability to handle non-linear relationships, its flexibility in handling various types of data, and its capability to handle missing data. However, it may suffer from overfitting if the number of trees in the Random Forest is too high. Improvements can be made through feature selection techniques and the use of more advanced machine learning algorithms.

In summary, this machine learning model provides a robust pipeline for regression tasks with numerical target variables, leveraging polynomial features and Random Forest regression for accurate predictions.
